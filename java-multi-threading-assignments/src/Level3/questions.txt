ðŸŸ  LEVEL 3 â€” INTER-THREAD COMMUNICATION

Coordinate producers and consumers safely.


ðŸ§© Q13 â€“ Producerâ€“Consumer (wait/notify)

Goal: Build classic producer-consumer model.
Requirements:

Shared buffer (size 5).

Producer adds items; waits if full.

Consumer removes items; waits if empty.

Use wait() / notifyAll().

Hint: Always call wait inside a while loop.

ðŸ§© Q14 â€“ Producerâ€“Consumer (BlockingQueue)

Goal: Simplify inter-thread coordination.
Requirements:

Use LinkedBlockingQueue instead of manual wait/notify.

Producer adds items, consumer removes.

ðŸ§© Q15 â€“ Spurious Wakeups

Goal: Demonstrate best practice.
Requirements:

Modify previous wait/notify code.

Place wait() inside while(!condition) not if.

Explain reason (spurious wakeup protection).

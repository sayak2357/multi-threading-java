Advantages:
1. Resource management as no time spent on creating and destroying new threads
2. Response time reduced
3. Control over thread count

For thread pooling we use Executor Framework

Introduced in Java 5 as part of java.util.concurrent package to simplify development of concurrent applications by abstracting away many of the complexities
involved in creating and managing threads.

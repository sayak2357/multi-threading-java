# Semaphore is like lock but can hold count of allowed consumers instead of just binary.
# Can restrict number of users per critical section.
# Any thread can release a semaphore ie no ownership.
# Inter thread communication for producer consumer, using semaphore

# Difference between Semaphore & Lock
1. Semaphore doesn't have notion of owner thread.
2. Multiple threads can acquire permit.
3. Same thread can acquire the semaphore multiple times.
4. The binary semaphore (initialized with 1) is not reentrant.
   eg.
     Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(1);
     void function(){
        semaphore.acquire();
        semaphore.acquire();  // Thread blocked
     }

5. Semaphore can be released by any thread, even by which hasn't acquired.
